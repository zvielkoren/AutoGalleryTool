The AutoGalleryTool system is an automated solution for sharing media files, allowing for filtering and cataloging of images and videos.

- **Customization**: You can customize the gallery layout, including the number of columns and the thumbnail size.
    - **User-Friendly Interface**: The script provides a user-friendly interface for selecting the directory and configuring
      the gallery settings.
    - **Flexible Output**: The generated HTML gallery can be easily integrated into your website or shared with others.
